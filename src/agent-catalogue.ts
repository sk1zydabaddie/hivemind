/**
 * The coding agents Hivemind can run, and what is actually true about each.
 *
 * Hivemind is an agent development environment: a coding agent is a *harness*
 * that runs inside it, paid for by whatever subscription the person already
 * has. Hivemind never holds a provider credential of its own, so this catalogue
 * describes binaries and flags, never keys.
 *
 * The status field is the honest part. `supported` means real runs have gone
 * through it end to end; anything else says what specifically is missing. A
 * picker implying five integrations would be a lie the first run exposes, and
 * a spending limit built on unverified usage numbers is worse than no
 * integration at all -- so an agent whose usage parsing has never been seen
 * live cannot be `supported`, however well it is fixture-tested.
